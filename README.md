# leaflet-challenge
## Objective
The main purpose of this repository is to display the data from "All Earthquakes from the past 7 days" from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson using Leaflet.
## Description
This repository does the following actions:
- Creates a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
- Creates circle markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
- Includes popups that provide the place, the magnitude and the depth
- Includes a legend section with the depth information
- Includes 2 map views: light (default) and outdoors.
